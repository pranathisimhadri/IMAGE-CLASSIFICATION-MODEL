## üñºÔ∏è Image Classification with CNN in PyTorch

This project demonstrates a simple yet effective **Image Classification** pipeline using a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** built with **PyTorch**. The goal is to classify images into predefined categories using deep learning.

The implementation is done in a **Jupyter Notebook**, making it easy to experiment with model architecture, training loops, and visualizations. This project is ideal for anyone starting out with **PyTorch** and **computer vision**.

## üìå Problem Statement

Image classification is a fundamental task in computer vision where the objective is to assign an image to one of several categories. This project builds a CNN from scratch using PyTorch to learn and classify patterns from image datasets.

It focuses on understanding the **training loop**, **custom dataset handling**, and **CNN construction** using core PyTorch modules‚Äîwithout relying on pre-trained models.

## üß† Workflow Overview

### 1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing**

* The dataset is loaded using `torchvision.datasets.ImageFolder` or a similar dataset utility.
* Data transformations using `torchvision.transforms` include:

  * Resizing
  * Normalization
  * Data Augmentation (Random Crop, Flip, Rotation)
* Data loaders are created using `DataLoader` for batching, shuffling, and parallel loading.

### 2. **CNN Architecture (Custom Model)**

A simple CNN is built using `nn.Module` or `nn.Sequential`, typically consisting of:

* `Conv2d` ‚Üí `ReLU` ‚Üí `MaxPool2d`
* Flatten ‚Üí `Linear` ‚Üí `ReLU` ‚Üí Dropout (optional)
* Final `Linear` ‚Üí Softmax or LogSoftmax output

This setup captures low- to high-level features from the image progressively.

### 3. **Model Training Loop**

* Standard PyTorch training loop with:

  * Forward pass
  * Loss computation (typically `nn.CrossEntropyLoss`)
  * Backward pass (`loss.backward()`)
  * Parameter update with `optim.Adam` or `optim.SGD`

* Model performance is monitored per epoch.

### 4. **Evaluation and Accuracy**

* The model is evaluated on the validation/test set.

* Metrics include:

  * Accuracy
  * Confusion Matrix (optional using `sklearn.metrics`)
  * Loss curves

* Optionally, visualize some predictions vs. ground truth.

## üöÄ How to Run

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Place your dataset in the expected format (e.g., `train/`, `test/` folders).
3. Open the notebook (`task3.ipynb`) in **Jupyter** or **JupyterLab**.
4. Run all cells in order:

   * Import libraries
   * Load and preprocess data
   * Build the CNN
   * Train the model
   * Evaluate and test predictions

---

## üì¶ Applications

* Digit, object, or animal classification
* Base for more advanced computer vision tasks like segmentation
* Educational intro to PyTorch + CNNs
